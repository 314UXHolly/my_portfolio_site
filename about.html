<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p class="sansserif">
        Accessibility, diversity, and inclusion are a principal interests and growing area of expertise
        that I am pursuing with vigor. I believe that every person should have equal access, not just to physical,
        but also to digital space. With this in mind, whether I'm designing a website or conducting user testing, I do my
        very best to integrate principles that embrace these philosophies, always searching for ways to
        identify trouble spots and execute solutions to raise the bar. What I hope to do even more often, is
        to proactively look ahead and design solutions before they ever have a chance to be a problem.
</p>

<p class="sansserif">
        Integrating the principles of customer experience, user experience, design for digital spaces,
        accessibility in the digital realm, and universal design for physical space. I hope to help the growing movement
        to achieve a standard in which diversity and inclusion on every level is simply the status quo, not
        an optional ala carte consideration.

<h3>Learning to Adult</h3>

<p class="sansserif">
    The tools we use and the experiences we have should be aesthetically pleasing, but most of all they should
    be user-friendly, enjoyable, and definitely shouldn't require a 3" thick manual to get started.
    For the whole of my career, my work has always been focused on addressing and meeting the needs of
    customers. I've done a little bit of everything. As a kid, I sold "collages" door-to-door (those quotes are quite intentional),
    I got my worker's permit at fifteen and slung pizza slices at the mall, cashiered at the local grocery, and
    spent a few years wearing out the soles of my shoes waiting tables in local eateries. I ran the customer service counter
    at a Woolworth's, helped run estate sales for the family business, worked for a Fortune 500 company developing and delivering training cirriculum for an ERP system
    and spent ten years working with students at a fancy university. Last year, I began my
    study of user experience as a formal practice -- it has been a deep dive into an ocean of new perspective
    and a life-changing one. My commitment to a career of service is stronger than ever. What greater gift is there
    than knowing you made something a little easier or even enjoyable for another person!

<h3>Codergirl</h3>

<p class="sansserif">
    I was introduced to Codergirl by a friend and signed up for the User Experience Design track
    not fully understanding what I was getting into. But, I trusted that it would, at a minimum, be
    a new and interesting opportunity to learn. Because of my experience in Codergirl, the trajectory
    of my career path altered, but it also shifted how I hope to impact and shape the world around me.
    I've always enjoyed spending time with people and getting to know them, but this gave me tools to
    explore further, collective quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to support insights,
    and new ways to identify, document, and implement changes that would result in better and more
    enjoyable experiences for the people I wished to help.
